<h1>User Research for Klimatkoll webbapplication</h1>
<p>For the development of the KlimatKoll app, user research was crucial to understanding the needs and behaviors of elderly users regarding environmental issues. 
   The goal was to create a product that was both accessible and engaging for users who may have limited experience with digital technology.</p>
<p>Based on the research findings, we simplified the navigation by reducing the number of menu options and incorporating larger, more readable fonts.<br>
   The app's main page was redesigned to include clear, actionable steps for learning about sustainability, paired with illustrations to make the content more engaging.<br>

<h1>User Research for Syla consulting webpage</h1>
<p> As part of a school project, our team was tasked with designing and developing a professional website for Syla Consulting. <br>
    We started from scratch, building both the website and the graphic profile from the ground up.<br>
    The primary objective of this project was to create an intuitive and modern web experience that reflects Syla Consulting's values and services in the import and export industry.
    The website needed to communicate professionalism, trustworthiness, and expertise while maintaining ease of navigation for users of different backgrounds.<br>
    We developed user personas based on potential clients—small-to-medium enterprises looking for consulting services in international trade. This helped us define key features and the overall design layout.<br>
    Based on our research, we created wireframes and lo-fi prototypes to outline the website's structure. After several iterations, we built a hi-fi prototype ensuring the visual identity and user interface met the project goals.<br>

<h1>User Research for Retreat hotel website</h1>
<p>This project was part of a school assignment where I designed a fictional luxury hotel website for "The Alpine Retreat." The aim was to create a modern and luxurious online presence that reflects the hotel’s serene mountain setting and high-end offerings.<br> 
   I built the website and graphic profile entirely from scratch, ensuring that it aligned with the expectations of potential guests looking for a premium experience. I identified potential target users, such as high-income individuals and couples looking for a peaceful and luxurious getaway.<br>
   Personas helped focus on key aspects of the site: visually stunning imagery, clear room information, and an easy-to-use booking interface. Through hypothetical surveys and research, we gathered insights into the preferences and behaviors of luxury travelers.<br>
   Key takeaways included a preference for minimalistic design, large high-quality images, and easy-to-navigate pages. After compiling our research, we created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the user journey and website layout. <br>
   Once the wireframes were finalized, we developed a high-fidelity prototype to reflect the final visual design. The design included a clean and modern aesthetic, with calming colors and immersive photography to emphasize the beauty of the hotel.<br>
   We conducted several rounds of usability testing with our high-fidelity prototype. Users were guided through tasks such as exploring room details and completing a booking. Based on their feedback, we made adjustments to improve the booking flow.<br>
